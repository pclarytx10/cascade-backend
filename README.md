## Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

- [ ] A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku & Netlify.

- [ ] Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**:
  - [ ] MongoDB/Mongoose
  - [ ] Express
  - [ ] React
  - [ ] Node
  - [ ] Bcrypt
- [ ] **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express ** backend via AJAX.

- [ ] **Must follow MVC architecture**

- [ ] **Include at least two of the four CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update & Delete) data operations/actions (having all four are optional)**

- [ ] **All team members are responsible for a minimum of 15 meaningful commits**

- [ ] **(OPTIONAL)** you can try to implement one or more of the following:
  - [ ] Consume a third-party API.
  - [ ] Include _admin_ features.
  - [ ] Client side routing to show multiple page-level components with React Router
  - [ ] Authentication, i.e. the ability of a user to log in & log out.
  - [ ] Authorization, by restricting functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.
  
## [](#best-practices)Best Practices

- [ ] **Write DRY code.**

- [ ] In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX. Build **RESTful APIs to CRUD your data entities (resources)** and perform other functionality via AJAX. In a React app, those AJAX calls should be made from "service" modules, not components.

- [ ] **Be consistent ** with your code style.

- [ ] **Clearly name variables and functions** - remember, variables are usually named as **nouns ** and functions as **verbs**.

- [ ] **Write well-formatted HTML/CSS/JS.** Properly formatting your code makes it more readable. Improperly formatted code infers sloppiness.

- [ ] **Comment your code where it makes sense**. Most code is self-documenting, however, comments help explain complicated code.
